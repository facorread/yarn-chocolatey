Yarn is a package manager for the npm and bower registries with a few specific focuses.

## Yarn Classic

This package is the latest version of Yarn in the Classic Stable line (`1.x`). The package maintainer plans to continue to release maintenance updates through Chocolatey when they are made available upstream.

While the Yarn Classic line (`1.x`) remains a pillar of the JavaScript ecosystem, upgrading to modern versions of Yarn is strongly recommended.

Modern versions of Yarn are managed through Corepack, which is also the only officially supported installation method. There are no oficially-available binaries for download through a package manager such as Chocolatey. Everyone should seriously consider migrating to modern versions of Yarn using Corepack.

To migrate, follow the [official migration instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/migration/overview) and, at your option, run `choco install yarn` as your first migration step.

## Features

**Determinism:** Based around a version lockfile which ensures that operations on the dependency graph can be easily transitioned. We check module directories and verify their integrity to ensure Yarn install always produces the same file structure.

**Security:** Strict guarantees are placed around package installation. You have control over whether lifecycle scripts are executed for packages and package hashes are stored in the lockfile to ensure you get the same package each time.

**Performance:** We're always performing operations such as package resolving and fetching in parallel. This ensures little idle time and maximum resource utilization.

## Notes

This package requires NodeJS. You can install via either the [nodejs](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs) or [nodejs-lts](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs-lts) package if you do not have it installed already.
